# To-do

## Priority
- [ ] Enhance "frame.generator.add_png_to_Images" to make sure that adjacent areas do not have identical images in them

## Secondary
- [ ] Find better way to set drawable areas  
- [ ] Improve code of "frame_generator.compute_drawable_areas", it sucks 
- [ ] Find the right "magic number" in "frame_generator.random_coordinates" for improve performance
